# --- Multi-User, Slow-Endpoint Safe Backend Design ---
# We use a thread-safe queue to buffer incoming requests, and a background worker thread
# to process them one at a time. This ensures that if the Azure LLM endpoint is slow,
# requests are not lost or failed, but are processed in order. Each request is assigned
# a unique request_id, and results are stored in a thread-safe dictionary for later retrieval.

# Thread-safe queue for incoming requests. The maxsize limits how many can wait at once.
REQUEST_QUEUE = queue.Queue(maxsize=20)  # Limit queue size to prevent overload

# Dictionary to store results or status for each request_id. Protected by a lock for thread safety.
RESULTS = {}
